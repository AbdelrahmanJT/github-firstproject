                <p class="writings">The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, also known as the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, is home to more than 120,000 pieces of ancient Egypt. Designed by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon, the building is one of the largest museums in the region. It was first built in 1835, but was moved many times until it was finally moved to its current place in 1902 Tahrir Square. Here are 10 artefacts you’ve got to see on your visit to the Egyptian Museum.

                <p class="writings">Tutankhamun’s Mask, also known as the funerary mask of tutankhamun, is one of the most famous works of art in the world. Discovered by Howard Carter in 1925, it is the death mask of the Egyptian Pharaoh of 18th dynasty Tutankhamun who reigned 1332–1323 BC. The mask is made from 11kg of solid gold. According to Nicholas Reeves, an English Egyptologist, the mask is “not only the quintessential image from Tutankhamun’s tomb, it is perhaps the best-known object from ancient Egypt itself.”

                <p class="writings">Pseusennes I’s tomb was discovered by professor Pierre Montent, a French Egyptologist, in Tanis 1940. Unluckily, due to the moisture in the ground in Lower Egypt, most of the wooden objects had disintegrated. But the mask which is made of gold and lapis lazuli, a deep blue semi-precious stone, was recovered. The mask is considered as “one of the masterpieces of the treasure[s] of Tanis.”
